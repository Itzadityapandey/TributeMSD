      <h2>About Legend</h2>
      <p>
        Mahendra Singh Dhoni, popularly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian cricketer and one of the most
        successful captains in the history of Indian cricket. Born on July 7, 1981, in Ranchi, Jharkhand, Dhoni
        started his cricket journey as a talented wicket-keeper-batsman. He made his international debut in 2004 and
        quickly gained recognition for his explosive batting style and exceptional captaincy skills.

        Under Dhoni's captaincy, the Indian cricket team achieved remarkable success, winning major tournaments like
        the ICC World T20 in 2007, the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011, and the ICC Champions Trophy in 2013. Known
        for his calm and composed demeanor, Dhoni earned the nickname "Captain Cool" for his ability to make astute
        decisions and guide the team to victory, even in challenging situations.

        Apart from his leadership prowess, Dhoni was renowned for his batting prowess, known for his powerful
        striking and ability to finish matches with his trademark helicopter shot. He holds numerous records,
        including the most international matches as captain for India and the most stumpings by a wicket-keeper in
        international cricket.

        Dhoni bid farewell to international cricket in August 2020, leaving a lasting impact on the game and
        inspiring millions of aspiring cricketers. Beyond cricket, he is involved in various business ventures and
        has contributed to charitable causes. Dhoni's humble demeanor, remarkable achievements, and unmatched
        captaincy have made him an icon in the world of cricket, earning the admiration and respect of fans
        worldwide</p>
